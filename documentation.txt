# File Type Analyzer - Technical Documentation

## Overview
This application analyzes files to determine their type based on binary patterns. It uses four different string-matching algorithms and compares their performance.

## Architecture

### Main Components

1. **Analyzer.java**
   - Entry point for the Spring Boot application
   - Configures the application to exclude database auto-configuration

2. **AnalyzerService.java**
   - Core service that handles file analysis
   - Implements four pattern matching algorithms:
     - Brute Force: Simple character-by-character comparison
     - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP): Efficient string searching algorithm that preprocesses the pattern
     - Rabin-Karp (RKM): Uses hashing to find patterns in text
     - Sliding Window: Optimized approach for binary data comparison
   - Manages parallel processing of multiple files using ExecutorService
   - Loads patterns from the patterns.txt file

3. **RPFMAController.java**
   - REST controller that exposes the API endpoints
   - Handles file uploads and returns analysis results
   - Provides endpoints for file preview functionality

4. **DeepAnalysisService.java**
   - Performs detailed analysis of file content
   - Analyzes byte distribution and detects text encoding
   - Provides additional metadata about files

5. **WebConfig.java**
   - Configures Spring MVC
   - Sets up resource handlers and view controllers

### Data Models

1. **FileAnalysisResult**
   - Represents the result of file analysis
   - Contains file name, detected type, and algorithm performance metrics

2. **Pattern**
   - Represents a file signature pattern
   - Contains priority, byte pattern, and file type description

## Key Methods

### AnalyzerService

- **analyzeFiles(List<MultipartFile> files)**
  - Processes multiple files in parallel using a thread pool
  - Returns a list of FileAnalysisResult objects

- **analyzeFile(MultipartFile file)**
  - Analyzes a single file using all four algorithms
  - Measures performance of each algorithm
  - Returns a FileAnalysisResult with the detected file type

- **convertPatternToBytes(String pattern)**
  - Converts hex string patterns (like "25 50 44 46 2D") to byte arrays
  - Handles both space-separated hex values and escape sequences

- **loadPatterns()**
  - Loads file signature patterns from the patterns.txt resource file
  - Parses each line into a Pattern object with priority, byte pattern, and description

### Pattern Matching Algorithms

- **bruteForceSearch(byte[] content, byte[] pattern)**
  - Simple character-by-character comparison
  - Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is content length and m is pattern length

- **kmpSearch(byte[] content, byte[] pattern)**
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
  - Preprocesses the pattern to avoid unnecessary comparisons
  - Time complexity: O(n+m)

- **rabinKarpSearch(byte[] content, byte[] pattern)**
  - Uses rolling hash function to find pattern matches
  - Time complexity: O(n+m) average case, O(n*m) worst case

- **slidingWindowSearch(byte[] content, byte[] pattern)**
  - Optimized for binary data
  - Uses a sliding window approach
  - Time complexity: O(n)

## Configuration Files

- **application.properties**
  - Configures Spring Boot application
  - Sets file upload limits and server port

- **Patterns.txt**
  - Contains file signatures in the format: priority;"hex pattern";"description"
  - Used to identify file types based on their binary signatures

## Frontend

- **index.html**
  - Main user interface for the application
  - Provides drag-and-drop file upload functionality
  - Displays analysis results

- **main.js**
  - Handles user interactions
  - Manages file uploads and displays results
  - Communicates with the backend API

- **styles.css**
  - Defines the visual styling of the application

## Performance Considerations

- Files are processed in parallel to improve throughput
- Algorithm performance is measured and compared
- Large files are handled efficiently with streaming where possible
- File upload size is limited to prevent server overload

## Error Handling

- Failed file analyses are logged and gracefully handled
- Invalid patterns are reported but don't crash the application
- API errors return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
